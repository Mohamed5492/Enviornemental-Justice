      <h1> Enviornmental Justice </h1>
      <p>Enviornmental Justice is the problem of people overusing water, pollution, climate change, non-renewable
        energy
        sources, and many world issues. Athought this concept is very big
        accoring to <p><a href="https://www.apha.org/Topics-and-Issues/Environmental-Health/Environmental-Justice#:~:text=Why%20is%20environmental%20justice%20important,hazardous%20waste%20and%20extreme%20heat.">APHA</a></p>

        Environmental justice is a public health and human rights issue. Marginalized communities are disproportionately at risk of exposure to lead, air pollution, hazardous waste and extreme heat. Environmental exposures have been linked to various damaging health issues, including cancer, asthma and other respiratory diseases, cardiovascular disease, neurological diseases and developmental disabilities.

        The threat of climate change further exacerbates these environmental health risks. For example, climate change worsens heat waves, which have more severe impacts on certain populations including farmworkers.
